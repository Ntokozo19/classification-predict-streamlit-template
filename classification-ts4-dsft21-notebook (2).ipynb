    "Many companies are built around lessening oneâ€™s environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.\n",

    "_**Pro climate change hashtags:**_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most used pro climate change hashtag outside of the #climate is #beforetheflood. This hashtag comes from the documentary named Before the flood where the famous actor Leonardo DiCaprio meets with scientists, activists and world leaders to discuss the dangers of climate change and possible solutions. This documentary created a lot of awareness and education around climate change and the causes of it. It brought, to everyday people's TV screens, the truth about climate change and the true impact it has and will continue to have on the planet if we dont change our way of living. Since this show, many people have jumped on the pro climate change band wagon and have started speaking out, which is what we are seeing with this hashtag.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another famous hashtag in the pro climate change hashtags is the #ImVotingBecause. As Americans select their next president, voters share their thoughts as to why they have chosen their candidate with the hashtag #ImVotingBecause. The social media landscape shows that supporters are firm in their convictions and consider this election a historic one. This hashtag also falls under climate change issues because in America climate change has become one of the most important issues in politics and climate change supporters want to vote for a president who views climate change as a priority. Donald Trump was also a president who reversed a lot of work done by climate change advocates around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another hashtag that was in the top 5 was the #COP22 which is The 2016 United Nations Climate Change Conference that was an international meeting of political leaders and activists to discuss environmental issues. It was held in Marrakech, Morocco, on 7â€“18 November 2016. This is where the Trump administration formerly announced their plans to exit the climate change deal. Climate change supporters where not happy with this decision. This also exlains the #Trump which also appears at number 9 of the pro climate change hashshtags.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Anti climate change hashtags:**_\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number hastag used by anti climate changers is #MAGA. \"Make America Great Again\" or MAGA is a campaign slogan used in American politics popularized by Donald Trump in his successful 2016 presidential campaign. During his presidency Donald trump did not shy away from expressing his anti climate change views and his supporters didnt either. That is why #Trump is also the 3rd most frequently used hashtag in the anti climate change hashtags.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hashtags such as #Fakenews, #climatescam, #DrainTheSwamp also made it to the top hashtags and they are all related to anti climate chmage supporters who believe thet climate change is a lie or a scam which is also perpurtuated by Donald Trump. So we can see from all these hashtags that Donald Trump is the biggest leader who is anti climate change and who's supporters are also anti climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* TCOT which stands for Top Conservative On Twitter takes the number 8 spot. The term provides a way for conservatives in particular and Republicans in general to locate and follow the tweets of like-minded individuals. We're sensing a pattern here: Trump, top conservatives on twitter, make America great again, Drain the swamp\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Neutral climate change hashtags:**_\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the neutral category, a few of the top hashtags were not directly related to climate change eg. Hashtags like GlobalWarming, AmReading, budget and QandA could suggest that these tweets are made by people who are still undecided on the topic but could be open to discussions and are interested in finding new/more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In general neutral climate change tweets have hashtags that are not as polarized as the anti and pro hashtags.\n",
    "\n",
    "* America and China are responsible for 40% of the world's carbon emissions and are the most mentioned geopolitical entities in pro climate change tweets, most likely for this reason\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_**News climate change hashtags:**_\n",
    "\n",
    "* The hashtags in the news category are less emotive and aim to bring awareness to high profile topics related to climate change that are or were trending in the news. Examples of such hashtags include News and Science which would be used to indicate that the tweet contains information from a news outlet or a scientific study.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ParisAgreement, COP22 and Trump are popular hashtags. Trump made headlines when he pulled out of the climate agreement, so it makes sense that these hashtags would be trending in climate change news.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ClimateMarch - many protests have been held, some even global, to raise awareness about climate change. These protests usually make headlines and are featured on news sites\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural next step to take is to look at what other words are used in the tweets for each that can give us an indication of the sentiment. We will build word clouds to visualize these.\n"
